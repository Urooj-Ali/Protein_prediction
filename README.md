## ðŸ“Œ Protein Prediction Using Random Forest Regressor

In this data mining project, we explored the protein content of foods using the USDA FoodData Central Foundation dataset. We:

- Identified the top 10 most protein-dense foods.
- Compared average protein levels across food categories.
- Visualized protein variability using boxplots.
- Applied K-Means clustering to categorize foods as **Low**, **Medium**, or **High** in protein.
- Built a user-friendly, interactive dashboard to explore food categories.
- Trained a machine learning model (Random Forest) to predict protein content.

This project showcases how real-world nutritional data can be mined and modeled to support health decisions, food development, and personalized dietary planning.
